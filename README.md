# pokemonChallenge
We would like you to build a web page, using any front-end library/framework of your choice, and display the following data:     https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Biuni/PokemonGO-Pokedex/master/pokedex.json     The page should show at least the following information for each pokemon:  Name Number Type Height Weight Weaknesses Next Evolution    The data should be sorted alphabetically by name from A to Z. As long as you meet the minimum requirement, you have creative freedom to develop the concept in any way you like, within the allowed time.     Finally, how you choose to demonstrate the final product is up to you, our only ask is that you package up the source code for a developer review.     This normally takes between 30 minutes to 2 hours. You must spend no more than 3 hours.
